	<h1> All About Me </h1>
	<h2> Annabelle Sydney Resnick </h2>
	<img src="Annabelle.JPG" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p> My name is Annabelle Sydney Resnick I am from Greenwich, Connecticut. I am a Sophmore at the University of Georgia, for people who hasn't heard of the University of Georgia before here is there home page! <a href="https://www.uga.edu/"> Go Visit the website.</a> Because I am so far away from Athens one might ask itself why I chose to go to University Georgia and the short answer is because I am a third generation bulldog which means my mom, aunt, and Grandfather all went here. But, thats not the only reason why I chose UGA, I also loved the campus itself along with the athletic's. </p>
	
	<h2> My Family </h2>
	<img src="Family.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> <img src="siblings.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p> I have two younger siblings, in whom still live at home. My brother "Grant" is 17 years old and who's dream is to go to the University of Georgia beside me. He is a very sweet, hard working, family oriented boy who I adore very very much. Beside him I have a 12 year old little sister named "Lauren" who is very outgoing, carefree, fun little girl who I always see myself laughing at constantly. Along with obviously my two supportive loving parents Cheryl and Jeff. We are just one big happy family. 
	
	<h2> My Beautiful Dogs </h2>
	<img src="Bella.JPG" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> <img src= "Dudley.jpg" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
	<p> You may be asking yourself how could this family get any bigger with a total of five people. But, like others my family would not be able to function without our beautiful dogs Dudley and Bella. Dudley who is a black and white Schnoodle <i> (A schnauzer and a poodle.) </i>
